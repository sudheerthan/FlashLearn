# FlashLearn

FlashLearn is a modern, intuitive flashcard application built with Flutter, designed to help you learn and memorize information effectively. It incorporates spaced repetition principles and offers a clean, user-friendly interface.

## Features

-   **Flashcard Management:** Add, view, and delete flashcards.
-   **Spaced Repetition:** Cards are prioritized based on your review performance (Hard, Good, Easy).
-   **Study Mode:**
    -   Swipe through flashcards to review.
    -   Mark cards as "Hard," "Good," or "Easy" to update their review priority.
    -   Option to mark cards as "Complete" to move them to a separate section.
-   **Bulk Add:** Quickly add multiple flashcards by pasting questions and answers in a simple format (Q,A per line).
-   **Active/Completed Sections:** Organize your flashcards into active study and completed sections.
